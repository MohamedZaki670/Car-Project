        to reinterpret freedom. For unconditional driving pleasure, as far as the road goes. From the first glimpse of
        the iconic design adrenaline levels rise. The tachometer shoots up just as fast: the innovative plug-in hybrid
        engine generates 374 hp and 570 Nm and accelerates the BMW i8 Roadster from 0 to 100 km/ h in just 4.6 seconds.

        The BMW i8 Roadster reveals itself as futuristic right down to the last detail. Its progressive lines speak a
        formal language that can hardly be more dynamic. The most striking feature: the imposing lightweight
        carbon-fibre hinged doors, which can be opened comfortably. The athletic front continues to display the
        individual character of the car and proudly bears the BMW double kidney, flanked by full-LED headlights and
        redesigned Air Curtains. Starting at the

        bonnet, the distinctive V-shaped black belt stretches along the entire car, underscoring its flat silhouette.
        The impressive streamflow design also optimises airflow and creates unprecedented aerodynamics. Thus, the BMW i8
        Roadster is a perfect symbiosis of form and function that knows only one destination: ultimate freedom.

        The interior of the BMW i8 Roadster also underscores its unique character. This is immediately apparent from the
        exclusive feature line Accaro Amido/E-Copper. The interior also reflects the dynamic lines of the exterior
        design, creating a futuristic dynamic throughout the cockpit. The centre cockpit is inclined to the driver and
        the controls are arranged intuitively – ensuring maximum driver orientation and clarity. Optimum lateral support
        and maximum comfort are provided by the new electrically-adjustable sport seats with memory function. Behind the
        seats is additional storage space. With the optional Travel Packet, retractable dividers and an extra Nappa
        Leather map pocket are available. In the dark, the LED interior lighting ensures a high-quality ambience. The
        contour lines of the doors, the instrument panel, the centre console and the steering wheel can be optionally
        and alternately dipped in the colours EfficientDynamics Blue, Amber Yellow and White.

            Perfectly topping up the brilliant appearance: the 20” light-alloy wheels 516 in Jet Black matt. Its
            characteristic rim design not only refers directly to a genuine BMW i, but also fits perfectly with the
            iconic
            appearance of the BMW i8 Roadster.
