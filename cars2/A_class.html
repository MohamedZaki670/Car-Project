        The interior of the BMW i8 Roadster also underscores its unique character. This is immediately apparent from the
        exclusive feature line Accaro Amido/E-Copper. The interior also reflects the dynamic lines of the exterior
        design, creating a futuristic dynamic throughout the cockpit. The centre cockpit is inclined to the driver and
        the controls are arranged intuitively â€“ ensuring maximum driver orientation and clarity. Optimum lateral support
        and maximum comfort are provided by the new electrically-adjustable sport seats with memory function. Behind the
        seats is additional storage space. With the optional Travel Packet, retractable dividers and an extra Nappa
        Leather map pocket are available. In the dark, the LED interior lighting ensures a high-quality ambience. The
        contour lines of the doors, the instrument panel, the centre console and the steering wheel can be optionally
        and alternately dipped in the colours EfficientDynamics Blue, Amber Yellow and White.
