        <b> Panoramic sunroof</b><br>

        With the panoramic roof you can create a particularly bright, friendly atmosphere in the interior. The glass
        module stretches across the entire roof area, thus creating the impression of a continuous glass area from where
        the windscreen begins to where the rear window ends. You are protected from strong sunlight by a manual roller
        sun blind.

        <b>AMG matt carbon-fibre trim elements</b> <br>

        The trim lends your interior an individual look. It blends in harmoniously while also creating exciting
        contrasts. As such it reinforces and underscores the interior design. At the same time, the trim is a
        continually discernible sign of the quality of a meticulously finished premium product.

        digital instruments and a 31.2cm (10.2-inch) display. Centre-stage is <br>
        the new centre console with innovative display switches. The AMG Performance <br>
        steering wheel in nappa leather with AMG steering wheel buttons ensures a firm grip on proceedings. <br>
        Materials worked to exquisite standards of craftsmanship <br>
        bestow a hand-made quality on the vehicle interior.

        The interior of the BMW i8 Roadster also underscores its unique character. This is immediately apparent from the
        exclusive feature line Accaro Amido/E-Copper. The interior also reflects the dynamic lines of the exterior
        design, creating a futuristic dynamic throughout the cockpit. The centre cockpit is inclined to the driver and
        the controls are arranged intuitively – ensuring maximum driver orientation and clarity. Optimum lateral support
        and maximum comfort are provided by the new electrically-adjustable sport seats with memory function. Behind the
        seats is additional storage space. With the optional Travel Packet, retractable dividers and an extra Nappa
        Leather map pocket are available. In the dark, the LED interior lighting ensures a high-quality ambience. The
        contour lines of the doors, the instrument panel, the centre console and the steering wheel can be optionally
        and alternately dipped in the colours EfficientDynamics Blue, Amber Yellow and White.

            Positioned for the ultimate in sporty performance, the optional AMG Performance seats provide the essential
            basis for fully assured handling. The strongly contoured seat shape with integral head restraints and AMG
            badge combines ideal lateral support when adopting a sporty driving style with a particularly dynamic
            appearance. Following the facelift, they are now available in an additional upholstery variant.
