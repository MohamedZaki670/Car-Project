        An entirely new concept of sports car. More efficient – for example due to
        intelligent lightweight construction with carbon and aerodynamic design. More
        sustainable – with highly efficient BMW eDrive technology and recyclable
        materials in the interior. Without forfeiting dynamics and its sporting
        appearance. No compromises, but instead the optimum combination of driving
        pleasure and responsibility. The BMW i8 is a plug-in-hybrid that brings
        together the advantages of innovate electric motor and combustion engine
        technologies. The result is an extraordinary driving experience – with extremely
        low consumption and low emissions.

        demonstrates the interplay of these ideals: hugging the ground and in the in the unrivalled form you expect of a
        BMW.
