                The DNA of an off-road vehicle: iconic, robust and virtually indestructible. They designed parts which continue to perform the very same functions to this day.
                        Components which have given rise to a highly distinct character over generations.

                The new GLE - a picture of poise and composure.
                <br>
                Sensual surfaces, muscular forms and clear lines define the design of the new GLE. It is hard to imagine a more elegant and dynamic expression of power.
                Chase it all: fast in the daily routine. Even faster at the weekend.
                The new performance SUV from Mercedes-AMG.
                Sportiness meets off-road capability meets everyday practicality - the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 4MATIC+ combines apparent opposites into an exciting whole. The new AMG-specific radiator trim in A-shape with vertical struts makes it clear right away that this vehicle belongs to the AMG model family. Its brawny power and unbridled sporty character provide for off-road thrills, while its spaciousness and easy handling make it an ideal everyday vehicle in the city.

                        MBUX offers users maximum freedom for controlling all functions in the way most comfortable and convenient to them. Whether using voice control or intuitive touch functions. The new GLE comes with the option of a multimedia touch display. There is also a touchpad integrated in the centre console, which responds to single and multi-finger gestures as well as handwriting. Furthermore, the displays can be controlled using Touch Control buttons on the steering wheel.

        "Hey Mercedes." These two initial words start the natural, intuitive LINGUATRONIC voice control system which comes as standard. It reacts to almost every word. The system can even process indirect speech â€“ the air conditioning will respond, e.g. to "I feel cold" and increase the temperature setting. At the same time the voice control also has learning capability. It attunes itself to your voice and thus understands you better.

                    With the new E-ACTIVE BODY CONTROL fully active air suspension, we are pooling our most innovative and intelligent suspension technologies to create a mesmerising driving experience.

        In "Curve" mode, the vehicle can actively lean into a bend. This minimises the transverse force and tangibly increases comfort and dynamism. In "Comfort" mode, the ROAD SURFACE SCAN with stereo camera scans the road ahead of the vehicle. The suspension struts are then activated so as to substantially reduce the body movements when driving over bumps in the road. There are two other modes to choose from: "Sport" and "Offroad".

        The new GLE even takes the strain off the driver when it comes to manoeuvring with a trailer.. Exemplary safety with Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Drive systems.
           In the rush hour, during a long drive at night or on an unfamiliar route, your GLE noticeably takes the strain out of driving, particularly in stressful situations. This is based on a concept that makes every journey in a Mercedes-Benz safer and unique: Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Drive. Because the time you spend behind the wheel is your time. Time for relaxation. Time to replenish your energy. So that, first and foremost, you reach your destination safely, but are also more relaxed when you get there.
           Allow us to smooth the way for you.
           The new GLC not only adapts to the road surface, it also responds to your requirements: the AGILITY CONTROL suspension, configured for outstanding ride comfort, comes as standard. Also available: 4MATIC all-wheel drive and the exceptionally sporty DYNAMIC BODY CONTROL suspension with steel springs and adjustable damping. Absolute highlight: the AIR BODY CONTROL air suspension for exceptional driving stability coupled with outstanding comfort and agility.
